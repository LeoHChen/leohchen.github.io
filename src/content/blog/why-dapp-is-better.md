Most apps are operationally fragile. They depend on a company continuing to run servers, pay bills, maintain auth, and keep databases online. When the operator shuts down, the product effectively ceases to exist.

dApps change the failure mode.

Core application logic runs as smart contracts on a public chain. As long as the network continues to produce blocks, the system remains executable and state remains queryable. The original team can disappear and the application still works.

#### Protocol is the product, UI is replaceable

In centralized apps, the UI and backend are tightly coupled. If the hosted API goes down, the app is dead.

In dApps, the protocol is the backend. The UI is just one client. If a front end disappears, anyone can deploy a new one or interact directly through wallets, SDKs, indexers, scripts, or alternative clients. This makes the system resilient to organizational and infrastructure churn.

#### State is persistent and portable

Centralized apps typically store state in private databases with no credible persistence guarantee.

On-chain state is replicated and verifiable. Users can migrate to new clients without needing platform permission or data export workflows. For long-lived products, this is a structural advantage: *the data model is shared infrastructure*, not a business asset.

#### Governance and upgrades are explicit

A centralized operator can change rules unilaterally: terms, access, balances, APIs, moderation. That uncertainty compounds over time.

Smart contracts make control surfaces explicit. If contracts are immutable, rules are stable. If they’re upgradeable, the upgrade path is on-chain and observable. Either way, change becomes auditable, not discretionary.

#### Better long-term composition

Because the contract interface is public, other developers can build on top without vendor deals or integration permissions. That creates a compounding ecosystem effect: more integrations, more liquidity, more tooling, more distribution.

This is the key future-oriented property: **dApps turn applications into shared primitives that survive individual teams and companies.**

**Bottom line:** centralized apps are services that exist as long as someone operates them. dApps are protocols that keep running by default.
