  <h1>About</h1>

  <div style="max-width: 600px;">
    <p>
      This is my personal blog. I use it to capture ideas, random thoughts, and lessons from work and life. It's also a place to think in public. Writing helps me turn vague intuition into something concrete.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over time, this will become my digital footprint. If we ever reach AGI, maybe it can be used to build a digital twin that thinks roughly the way I do.

    <h2>About Me</h2>

      I'm <strong>Leo Chen</strong>. I'm a technical executive with <strong>25+ years in software engineering</strong>, and I still enjoy the part where you build something from nothing and make it real.
    </p>

    <p>I've worked across:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Embedded systems: device and OS</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Cloud infrastructure: virtualization engine and system architecture</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Blockchain: layer 1/2 and dApp</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I care about clean architecture, pragmatic execution, and continuous learning. If something takes effort to understand, it's probably worth documenting. If it takes effort to explain, it's probably worth simplifying.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of work, I spend time cooking, reading, listening to music, traveling, running, and hiking. I like long-distance things, both in engineering and in life.
